# Important

If updating from versions below 0.4.0:

Versions 0.4.0+ are not compatible with previous versions. Extract to an empty folder. Do not simply replace files with updated files.
Unfortunately this means that saved data from previous version cannot be carried over. Make sure to backup your data, e.g. downloaded replays
